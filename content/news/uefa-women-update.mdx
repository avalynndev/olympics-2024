## 2024/2025 UEFA Women’s Champions League Update

Action from the 2024/2025 UEFA Women’s Champions League is well underway, with round two qualifiers taking centre stage this week.

The winner of the 12 two-legged ties will join the already four qualified football teams in the pot for Friday’s (27 September) group stage draw.

FC Barcelona, Chelsea, Lyon, and Bayern Munich have automatically qualified for the groups as winners of their respective leagues.

But the stakes are high for the remaining hopefuls, who have one last chance to progress to the next round.

Read on to discover how things stand heading into the all-important second leg of the qualifiers…

### 2024/2025 UEFA Women’s Champions League Qualifiers: The state of play

Arguably the most high-profile clash in the second round of qualifiers is that of Juventus and Paris Saint-Germain, whose clash last week did not disappoint. After taking the lead inside 10 minutes, Juventus were pegged back soon after. But a further two goals either side of half-time saw them take a 3-1 lead into the next game, though this time it’ll be away from home. The pressure will be on for this week’s home side after heavily investing in the summer – bringing in the likes of Mary Earps and Griedge Mbock – to get into the groups.

Another side feeling the pressure is Arsenal. Still the only English side to win this competition, their hopes of making the groups now hang in the balance. Last season they were pipped to a spot in the last 16 by Paris FC, and this time it is BK Hacken threatening to derail their European hopes. Despite losing several key players in the summer, including Rosa Kafaji to the Gunners, the Swedish side has proved it’s all about the coaching as opposed to the personnel with their one-goal lead going into the second leg. But up against one of the most vocal sets of fans in women’s football right now, they will have their work cut out away from home on Thursday, 26 September.

Last year’s runners-up in this competition – Wolfsburg – all but booked their place in the groups of this season’s edition with a thumping 7-0 victory over Fiorentina. Another side that have lost key players in the summer transfer window, the German giants has hit the ground running as if it were business as usual. Unsurprisingly, captain Alexandra Popp is among the remaining stars to step up, bagging a hat-trick in the first leg at both sides of the interval.

Manchester City are looking to make the most of their return to the UWCL. They missed out on the competition entirely last term thanks to their neighbouring rivals Manchester United breaking into the top three at their expense. But a second-place finish in the WSL saw them back in the mix, and they put one foot into the groups with a 5-0 win over Paris FC away from home. New recruit Vivianne Miedema opened the scoring, netting her first goal for the Blues, while Jess Park’s brace, followed by strikes from Mary Fowler and Chloe Kelly, sealed the win. Gareth Taylor’s side is aiming to reach the next stage for the first time since 2020/21, where they ventured to the quarter-finals.
