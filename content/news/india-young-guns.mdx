A 61-member Indian shooting contingent will compete at the ISSF Junior World Championship 2024 at the Las Palmas Shooting Range in Lima, Peru from September 27 to October 6.

Live streaming of the ISSF Junior World Championship 2024 will be available in India.

The Junior Shooting World Championship, now in its fourth edition, will see India vie for medals in pistol, rifle and shotgun competitions in the Under-21 age category. Competitions will be held in Olympic shooting as well as non-Olympic disciplines.

The last edition of the ISSF Junior World Championship was held in Changwon in 2023. India had finished with 17 medals, including six gold, six silver and five bronze. Seven Indian shooters managed to bag more than one medal.

Abhinav Shaw, who won gold medals in the men's 10m air rifle and the mixed team last year, returns for the 2024 edition.

India had finished second behind the People's Republic of China last year, who topped the medals tally with 12 golds, nine silvers and seven bronze for a total of 28 medals. This year, China have sent only seven shooters.

India's total of 61 shooters for the 2024 Junior World Championship is the largest, followed by the United States, who have fielded 40 shooters.

Over 560 shooters from 51 countries will participate in the ISSF Junior World Championship 2024.
