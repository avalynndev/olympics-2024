Shohei Ohtani has won a piece of baseball history.

Again.

This time, the two-time American League MVP from Japan became the first-ever player in Major League Baseball to hit 50 home runs and steal 50 bases in a single season, as if he hasnâ€™t broken enough records in his seven-year big-league career.

Despite still recovering from an ulnar collateral ligament (UCL) tear in his right elbow, the history-making machine had already added another chapter to his lore in his first year with the Los Angeles Dodgers, joining the select 40-40 club on 23 August in style with a walk-off grand slam.

Ohtani is only the sixth player to have achieved the feat, and he did it faster than any of them - in just his 126th game, by a whopping 21 games over Alfonso Soriano in 2006.

A week later, the 30-year-old homered for No. 43 and swiped his 43rd base in the same game to become the only player to record a 43-43 campaign.

On 19 September, Ohtani hit the 50-50 plateau with a performance for the ages, belting three homers, stealing two bases and driving in 10 runs on a 6-for-6 night.
